Hi Daniel,

Instructions for opening the Assessment

1) Create empty database called scinexdavid. Import the attached scinexdavid.sql file into that database. 

2) Clone the Repo from my Github account:

   git clone https://github.com/chzplz21/scinexDavid.git

3) In the file db.php within scinexDavid, add your DB credentials.
	
	$username = "Your username"
	$password = "Your password"

4) The directory name is scinexDavid.  I visit the site by: localhost/scinexDavid

5) The two fictitious users that I created are Jimmy and Jenny.
	
	Login for Jimmy:

	username: Jimmy
	password: boo

	Login for Jenny:
	
	username: Jenny
	password: foo


Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
